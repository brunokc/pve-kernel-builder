# 🍻 Relaxed RMRR Mapping for Linux 5.15+
## 🐧💨 Now you can use PCI passthrough on broken platforms

### TL;DR
When you try to use PCI/PCIe passthrough in KVM/QEMU/Proxmox you get:
```
vfio-pci 0000:01:00.1: Device is ineligible for IOMMU domain attach due to platform RMRR requirement. Contact your platform vendor.
```
followed by `vfio: failed to set iommu for container: Operation not permitted`.

This kernel patch fixes the problem **on kernels v5.15 and up** (tested up to 5.15.107). You can skip to 
"[Installation](README.md#installation)" section if you don't care about the rest. Reading of 
"[Disclaimers](README.md#disclaimers)" section to understand the risks, and 
"[Solutions & hacks](deep-dive.md#other-solutions--hacks)" to get the idea of different alternatives is 
highly recommended.

### Installation

#### Proxmox - premade packages (easy)
As I believe in *[eating your own dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)* I run the kernel
described here. Thus, I publish precompiled packages.

1. Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/kiler129/relax-intel-rmrr/releases/) and pick appropriate packages
2. Download all `*.deb`s packages to the server (you can copy links and use `wget https://...` on the server itself)
3. Install all using `dpkg -i *.deb` in the folder where you downloaded the debs
4. *(OPTIONAL)* Verify the kernel works with the patch disabled by rebooting and checking if `uname -r` shows a version 
   ending with `-pve-relaxablermrr`
5. [Configure the kernel](README.md#configuration)

---

#### Proxmox - building from sources (advanced)
If you're running a version of Proxmox with [no packages available](README.md#proxmox---premade-packages-easy) you can
[compile the kernel yourself using patches provided](build/proxmox/).

---

#### Other distros
1. Download kernel sources appropriate for your distribution
2. Apply an appropriate patch to the source tree
    - Go to the folder with your kernel source
    - For Linux 3.17 - 5.7: `patch -p1 < ../patches/add-relaxable-rmrr-below-5_8.patch`
    - For Linux >=5.8: `patch -p1 < ../patches/add-relaxable-rmrr-5_8_and_up.patch`
3. Follow your distro kernel compilation & installation instruction:
    - [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/BuildADebianKernelPackage)
    - [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/BuildYourOwnKernel)

***TODO:*** *Add automation script*

---

### Configuration

By default, after the kernel is installed, the patch will be *inactive* (i.e. the kernel will behave like this patch was
never applied). To activate it you have to add `relax_rmrr` to the `intel_iommu` option on your Linux boot args.

In most distros (including Proxmox) you do this by:

1. Opening `/etc/default/grub` (e.g. using `nano /etc/default/grub`)
2. Editing the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` to include the option:

    - Example of old line:
        ```
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt intremap=no_x2apic_optout"
        ```
    - Example of new line:
        ```
        GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet intel_iommu=on,relax_rmrr iommu=pt intremap=no_x2apic_optout"
        ```
    - *Side note: these are actually options which will make your PCI passthrough work and do so efficiently*
3. Running `update-grub`
4. Rebooting

To verify if the the patch is active execute `dmesg | grep 'Intel-IOMMU'` after reboot. You should see a result similar
 to this:
 
```
root@sandbox:~# dmesg | grep 'Intel-IOMMU'
[    0.050195] DMAR: Intel-IOMMU: assuming all RMRRs are relaxable. This can lead to instability or data loss
root@sandbox:~# 
```

### Disclaimers
 - I'm not a kernel programmer by any means, so if I got something horribly wrong correct me please :)
 - This path should be safe, as long as you don't try to remap devices which are used by the IPMI/BIOS, e.g.
   - Network port shared between your IPMI and OS
   - RAID card in non-HBA mode with its driver loaded on the host
   - Network card with monitoring system installed on the host (e.g. [Intel Active Health System Agent](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-c04781229))
 - This is not a supported solution by any of the vendors. In fact this is a direct violation of Intel's VT-d specs 
   (which Linux already violates anyway, but this is increasing the scope). It may cause crashes or major instabilities.
   You've been warned.
